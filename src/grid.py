Modification: Ashton - Added a flag count
Purpose: This module defines the Cell and Grid classes, which represent the state of a Minesweeper game board. 
Each Cell tracks whether it contains a mine, whether it has been revealed or flagged, and how many adjacent mines it has. 
The Grid class manages a 2D array of Cells and provides methods to access their status and render the game state.
